# function-calling

Trying out openai function calling with some examples

- Adding an image url to a text
- Generate a list of job suggestions
- Parsing user interviews to extract insights

Interesting aspects:

- the use of pydantic
- extracting multiples values in one function vs multiple requests and functions
